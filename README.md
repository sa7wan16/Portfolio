* **Automating IP Access Updates**
  * In this project, I developed a python algorithm to update the list and automate the removal of IP addresses that no longer have access from the list. Additionally, I ensured 
    that the program handles potential errors, such as missing files or incorrect IP address formats, and confirm that the updated list of allowed IP addresses is correctly written 
    back to the file.
